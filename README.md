# NoFireworkBoost
Disables fireworks boosting Elytra flight in Minecraft

This works by immediately despawning fireworks within 1 block of a player, which prevents firework boosting. It will despawn regular fireworks if you try to launch them directly under you. It also might be a bit janky due to server latency or tickrate.
